# TODO: Comprehensive Testing and Fixes

## Overview
This TODO file tracks all testing tasks for the IBET wallet system. It includes completed tasks, current issues, and remaining work to ensure the system is fully tested and error-free.

**CRITICAL NOTE:** There are significant contradictions between this document and others (e.g., `WALLET_SECURITY_STATUS_REPORT.md`, `TODO_final_testing.md`) regarding the resolution of critical issues. This document reflects the current state of *failing tests* which must be addressed before the project can be considered stable or production-ready.

## Completed Tasks (Marked with [x])
### Corrupted Balance Fixes
- [x] Identify corrupted balances in database (dailywage_module_dailywagewallet ID 3: 999999999999.99, couple_module_couplewallet ID 3: 1000000002100.49)
- [x] Create fix script to reset corrupted balances to 1000.00
- [x] Execute fix script successfully
- [x] Verify no corrupted balances remain in database

### Basic Functionality Tests
- [x] Test welcome endpoints for all wallet modules (couple, individual, retiree, student, parent, dailywage)
- [x] Test basic wallet endpoints (balance, deposit) for individual wallets
- [x] Run check_corrupted_balances.py - confirmed no corrupted balances
- [x] Run fix_corrupted_balances_final.py - successfully fixed remaining balances (as per `TODO_final_testing.md`)

## Pending Tasks (Unmarked)

### Critical Test Failures (from Django Test Suite - 45 failures out of 163 tests)
### Django Test Suite Fixes (45 failures out of 163 tests)

#### 1. Authentication/Authorization Issues (401/404 errors) - CRITICAL
- [ ] Fix individual wallet functionality test (404 error)
- [ ] Fix couple wallet functionality test (401 error)
- [ ] Fix retiree wallet functionality test (404 error)
- [ ] Fix dailywage wallet functionality test (404 error)
- [ ] Fix student wallet functionality test (404 error)
- [ ] Fix parent wallet functionality test (404 error)
- [ ] Fix cross-module wallet interactions tests (401/404 errors)
- [ ] Fix wallet comprehensive coverage tests for all modules (401/404 errors)
- [ ] Fix wallet error handling test (404 error)
- [ ] Fix wallet OTP generation and verification tests (401/405 errors)

**Analysis:** Despite claims in `WALLET_SECURITY_STATUS_REPORT.md` and `TODO_final_testing.md` that 401/404/403 errors are fixed and permissions are correct, these tests are still failing. This indicates fundamental issues with user authentication, permission enforcement, or URL routing.

#### 2. Rate Limiting/Throttling Issues (429 errors) - HIGH
- [ ] Fix security headers test (429 not in expected status codes)
- [ ] Fix parent module OTP generation test (429 error)
- [ ] Fix wallet security features tests (429 errors)
- [ ] Investigate and fix rate limiting configuration causing excessive 429 responses
**Analysis:** `WALLET_SECURITY_STATUS_REPORT.md` details throttling, but tests report 429 errors. This suggests incomplete or misconfigured rate limiting.

#### 3. Security and Token Issues - HIGH
- [ ] Fix secure token generation test (token length mismatch: 43 != 32)
- [ ] Review and fix token generation logic in core/security.py
- [ ] Ensure consistent token lengths across all security utilities
**Analysis:** `TODO_FIXES.md` explicitly identifies this token length mismatch. This is a clear, actionable bug in `core/security.py`.

#### 4. Concurrent Operations - CRITICAL
- [ ] Fix wallet concurrent operations test (0 successful deposits)
- [ ] Implement proper locking mechanisms for concurrent wallet operations
- [ ] Test race condition handling in wallet transactions
**Analysis:** Major contradiction. `WALLET_SECURITY_STATUS_REPORT.md` and `TODO_concurrent_operations.md` claim atomic transactions with `select_for_update()` are fully implemented and tested. However, this test is failing with "0 successful deposits," indicating the race condition protection is either not working, incorrectly implemented, or the test itself is flawed.

#### 5. API Endpoint and Logic Issues - MEDIUM
- [ ] Verify all wallet module URLs are correctly configured
- [ ] Check view permissions and authentication requirements
- [ ] Ensure all endpoints return expected HTTP status codes
- [ ] Test all CRUD operations for wallet models

### Additional Testing Requirements (General)
### Additional Testing Requirements

#### Edge Case Testing
- [ ] Test wallet operations with invalid inputs (negative amounts, strings, etc.)
- [ ] Test wallet operations with insufficient balance
- [ ] Test OTP expiration and invalid OTP scenarios
- [ ] Test concurrent user access to same wallet

**Analysis:** `test_wallet_edge_cases_fixed.py` exists but its results are not integrated into the main Django test suite's 45 failures. Comprehensive edge case coverage is still needed.

#### Performance Testing
- [ ] Test system performance under high load
- [ ] Monitor database query performance
- [ ] Test API response times

#### Integration Testing
- [ ] Test complete user workflows (registration → wallet creation → transactions)
- [ ] Test cross-module interactions (parent-student wallet linking, as per `WALLET_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE_FINAL.md`)
- [ ] Test OTP generation and verification flows

#### Security Testing
- [ ] Verify all security headers are present on responses
- [ ] Test SQL injection prevention
- [ ] Test XSS prevention
- [ ] Test CSRF protection
- [ ] Audit authentication and authorization logic

### Module-Specific Testing
### Module-Specific Testing

#### Individual Module
- [ ] Complete all individual wallet endpoint tests
- [ ] Test savings goals functionality
- [ ] Test transaction history

#### Couple Module
- [ ] Complete couple wallet tests with OTP verification
- [ ] Test joint and individual deposits/withdrawals
- [ ] Test emergency fund transfers

#### Daily Wage Module
- [ ] Fix dailywage enhancements test (as per `DEBUGGING_ERRORS_TODO.md`, including `alert_threshold_in_serializer`, `alert_triggered_when_balance_low`, `monthly_progress_calculation`, `monthly_summary_endpoint`, `weekly_summary_with_alert`)
- [ ] Test daily earnings addition
- [ ] Test weekly progress tracking
- [ ] Test emergency fund transfers

#### Parent Module
- [ ] Test parent wallet operations
- [ ] Test student wallet linking and approval system
- [ ] Test transaction approval workflows

#### Student Module
- [ ] Test student wallet operations
- [ ] Test parent approval requirements
- [ ] Test savings goals tracking

#### Retiree Module
- [ ] Test pension and emergency fund deposits
- [ ] Test monthly expense tracking
- [ ] Test withdrawal operations

### Database and Migration Testing
### Database and Migration Testing
- [ ] Test all database migrations
- [ ] Verify data integrity after migrations
- [ ] Test backup and restore procedures

### Frontend Testing (Future)
- [ ] Test React frontend components
- [ ] Test API integration from frontend
- [ ] Test user interface responsiveness
- [ ] Test cross-browser compatibility
**Analysis:** Frontend development has not started yet, as per `TODO_MASTER.md`.

## Critical Path Items
1. Fix authentication/authorization issues (401/404 errors)
2. Resolve rate limiting problems (429 errors)
3. Fix token generation inconsistencies
4. Implement proper concurrent operation handling
5. Complete all wallet module endpoint tests and module-specific features.

## Time Estimates
- Fix authentication issues: 4-6 hours
- Resolve rate limiting: 2-3 hours
- Fix token generation: 1-2 hours
- Concurrent operations: 3-4 hours (re-audit and debug tests)
- Complete module testing: 6-8 hours
- Edge case and security testing: 4-6 hours
- Total: 20-29 hours

## Testing Status
- Basic corrupted balance fix: ✅ Complete
- **Django test suite: 118 passed, 45 failed (27% failure rate)**
- Overall system stability: **CRITICAL - Needs immediate improvement**
- Production readiness: **NOT READY** (requires fixing critical failures and resolving documentation contradictions)
