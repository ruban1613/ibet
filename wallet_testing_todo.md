# Comprehensive Wallet Testing Plan

## Current Status
- ✅ Couple Module: Already has comprehensive wallet testing
- ✅ Individual Module: Comprehensive wallet testing completed
- ✅ Retiree Module: Comprehensive wallet testing completed (test_retiree_wallet_final.py)
- ✅ Daily Wage Module: Comprehensive wallet testing completed (test_all_wallets_final.py)
- ❌ Security Features: Need testing across all modules
- ❌ Edge Cases: Need comprehensive error scenario testing
- ✅ Event Types: FUND_TRANSFER event types standardized across all wallet modules

## Testing Plan

### 1. Individual Module Wallet Testing
- [x] Test wallet balance retrieval
- [x] Test deposit functionality
- [x] Test withdrawal functionality
- [x] Test transfer to savings goals
- [x] Test OTP generation and verification (not applicable - individual wallets don't require OTP)
- [x] Test insufficient funds scenarios
- [x] Test invalid input validation
- [x] Test authentication requirements

### 2. Retiree Module Wallet Testing
- [x] Test wallet balance with pension balance
- [x] Test pension deposit functionality
- [x] Test emergency fund deposit functionality
- [x] Test withdrawal functionality
- [x] Test monthly expenses tracking
- [x] Test OTP generation and verification (not applicable - retiree wallets don't require OTP)
- [x] Test insufficient funds scenarios
- [x] Test invalid input validation

### 3. Daily Wage Module Wallet Testing
- [x] Test wallet balance with weekly progress
- [x] Test daily earnings addition
- [x] Test withdrawal functionality
- [x] Test emergency reserve transfers
- [x] Test weekly summary generation
- [x] Test OTP generation and verification
- [x] Test insufficient funds scenarios
- [x] Test invalid input validation

### 4. Security Features Testing
- [ ] Test OTP generation limits (rate limiting)
- [ ] Test OTP verification failures
- [ ] Test suspicious activity detection
- [ ] Test authentication bypass attempts
- [ ] Test unauthorized access attempts

### 5. Edge Cases and Error Testing
- [ ] Test negative amount inputs
- [ ] Test zero amount transactions
- [ ] Test extremely large amounts
- [ ] Test malformed request data
- [ ] Test concurrent transactions
- [ ] Test database connection failures
- [ ] Test timeout scenarios

## Pending Works

### Immediate Tasks
- [x] Fix remaining WALLET_TRANSFER event types in IBET/couple_module/views_wallet.py
- [x] Run comprehensive security testing across all modules (in progress - fixing URL issues and wallet creation)
- [ ] Implement edge case testing for all wallet operations
- [ ] Create automated test suite for continuous integration

### Long-term Tasks
- [ ] Performance testing under high load
- [ ] Database optimization for wallet operations
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting setup for wallet security events
- [ ] Documentation updates for wallet API endpoints

## Testing Approach
1. Start Django development server
2. Execute existing test files to establish baseline
3. Create comprehensive test scripts for each module
4. Test security features and edge cases
5. Generate detailed test reports
6. Identify and document any issues found
