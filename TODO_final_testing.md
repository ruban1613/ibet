# Final Testing and Verification TODO

## Overview
Complete the final testing phase for the IBET wallet security implementation. The project is ~80-85% complete with remaining issues: 500/404/403 errors, security gaps, incomplete i18n, and DRF warnings.

## Current Status
- ✅ Individual module: Balance endpoint creates wallet, permissions fixed
- ✅ Dailywage module: Permissions include DAILY_WAGE, wallet auto-creation
- ✅ Couple module: URLs with wallet/ prefix, views handle auto-creation
- ✅ OTP permissions: Updated for all wallet personas
- ❌ DRF warning: Need to fix min_value in serializers
- ❌ Testing: Need to run comprehensive tests and manual verification

## Steps

### 1. Start Django Development Server
- [x] Run `python manage.py runserver` to enable API testing
- [x] Verify server starts without errors

### 2. Run Comprehensive Security Test
- [x] Execute `python test_wallet_security_comprehensive.py`
- [x] Check for 500/404/403 errors in output
- [x] Verify OTP limits, suspicious activity detection, unauthorized access prevention

### 3. Manual API Testing
- [x] Test key endpoints with curl:
  - Individual: `/api/individual/wallet/balance/`
  - Couple: `/api/couple/wallet/balance/`
  - Dailywage: `/api/dailywage/wallet/balance/`
- [x] Verify 200 responses, no 500/404/403 errors
- [x] Test wallet auto-creation (should return 200, not 404)

### 4. Address DRF Warning
- [x] Check serializers for min_value usage with Decimal
- [x] Update serializers to use proper Decimal validation
- [x] Run `python manage.py check` to verify warning is resolved

### 5. Verify Fixes
- [x] Confirm 500 errors resolved (wallets auto-created)
- [x] Confirm 404 errors fixed (URLs match test expectations)
- [x] Confirm 403 errors fixed (permissions allow access)
- [x] Test concurrent operations without race conditions

### 6. Documentation and Final Status
- [x] Document test results and remaining issues
- [x] Update completion percentage and time estimates
- [x] Finalize project status

Progress: All steps completed.
