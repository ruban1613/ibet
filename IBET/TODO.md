# Authentication and Security Implementation TODO

## Current Status: In Progress

### ‚úÖ Completed
- [ ] Security analysis and planning
- [ ] TODO file creation

### üîÑ In Progress
- [ ] Core security service implementation
- [ ] OTP security fixes
- [ ] Enhanced permissions system

### ‚è≥ Pending
- [ ] Secure wallet access controls
- [ ] Enhanced parent-student linking security
- [ ] Rate limiting enhancements
- [ ] Security monitoring and audit
- [ ] Database migrations
- [ ] Comprehensive testing
- [ ] Documentation updates

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Core Security Infrastructure (Current)
1. **Create core security service** (`IBET/core/security.py`)
   - Secure OTP generation and validation
   - Security utilities and helpers
   - OTP expiration handling

2. **Fix critical OTP security vulnerability**
   - Remove OTP from API responses
   - Implement secure OTP delivery mechanism
   - Add OTP validation logic

3. **Create custom permissions** (`IBET/core/permissions.py`)
   - Wallet access permissions
   - Parent-student relationship validation
   - Security-based access controls

### Phase 2: Enhanced Security Features
4. **Implement security monitoring** (`IBET/core/security_monitoring.py`)
   - Security event logging
   - Suspicious activity detection
   - Audit trail for sensitive operations

5. **Enhance wallet access controls**
   - Update Wallet model with security methods
   - Implement access logging
   - Add ownership verification

6. **Secure parent-student linking**
   - Add security fields to ParentStudentLink model
   - Implement secure linking verification
   - Add linking approval workflow

### Phase 3: Advanced Security Features
7. **Enhanced rate limiting**
   - Granular throttling for different user personas
   - Dynamic throttling based on user behavior
   - Burst protection for sensitive operations

8. **Database migrations**
   - Create migrations for new security models
   - Apply migrations to update database schema

9. **Comprehensive testing**
   - Unit tests for security components
   - Integration tests for OTP flows
   - Security vulnerability testing

10. **Documentation and deployment**
    - Update API documentation
    - Security configuration guides
    - Deployment security checklist

## Security Issues to Fix

### Critical (High Priority)
- [ ] **OTP Exposure**: Current implementation returns OTP in API response
- [ ] **Missing OTP Delivery**: No secure delivery mechanism (SMS/email)
- [ ] **Weak Authorization**: Limited validation for wallet access

### Important (Medium Priority)
- [ ] **Audit Trail**: No comprehensive security event logging
- [ ] **Rate Limiting**: Could be more granular and adaptive
- [ ] **Access Controls**: Need more sophisticated permission system

### Enhancement (Low Priority)
- [ ] **Security Monitoring**: Real-time threat detection
- [ ] **Advanced Authentication**: Multi-factor authentication options
- [ ] **Security Reporting**: Automated security reports and alerts

## Testing Checklist

### Critical Path Testing
- [ ] OTP generation and validation
- [ ] Parent-student wallet access
- [ ] Rate limiting functionality
- [ ] Security middleware

### Thorough Testing
- [ ] All API endpoints with security
- [ ] Edge cases and error scenarios
- [ ] Performance under load
- [ ] Security vulnerability assessment

## Notes
- Start with Phase 1 critical security fixes
- Implement comprehensive logging throughout
- Ensure backward compatibility where possible
- Add proper error handling for all security operations
