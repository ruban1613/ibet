# Internationalization Implementation for couple_module/views_wallet.py

## Current Task: Wrap hardcoded strings in couple_module/views_wallet.py

### Information Gathered
- File already has `from django.utils.translation import gettext_lazy as _` import
- Many strings are already wrapped with `_()`
- Identified remaining hardcoded strings that need wrapping

### Plan
- Wrap hardcoded strings in deposit, withdraw, transfer_to_emergency, transfer_to_goals methods
- Ensure all user-facing strings are translatable

### Dependent Files to be edited
- ibet/IBET/couple_module/views_wallet.py

### Followup steps
- Verify all strings are properly wrapped
- Test that translations work correctly
